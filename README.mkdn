# Golden Grid System Compass Plugin

This plugin adds the Golden Grid System to [Compass](http://compass-style.org).

[Golden Grid System](http://goldengridsystem.com) is a fluid grid created by [Joni Korpi](http://jonikorpi.com) with
[four features](http://goldengridsystem.com/#features): columns, gutters, a baseline and a script.

## Install the gem

`gem install compass-golden-grid-system`

## Create a Compass project using Golden Grid System

`compass create -r ggs my_project --using ggs`

This will create a Compass project with the default directory structure
and use scss syntax.

See the Compass [Install](http://compass-style.org/install) page for
options.

### Sans Compass

Download the source and use it in your sass project.

## Usage

In the `sass` directory you will find the bootstrap file `GGS.scss`
which imports all of the component files.

### Partials

There are partials for each grid size:

- `_mobile.scss` the default layout of 4 columns
- `_tablet.scss` 8 column grid
- `_large.scss` 16 column grid

- `_type.scss` contains the type presets.(_I left the classes to remain consistent with the original `GGS.css` file but they aren't necessary._
)
- `_global.scss` is for styles shared by all layouts.

## Configuration Variables

From the GGS.scss file

- `$line: 24` - Line height
- `$column: 100% / 18` - Column width
- `$font-size: 16` - Base font size
- `$em: $font-size * 1` EM conversion

I've added:

- `$layout: 8 !default` - This variable is overridden in each layout.
- `$page: 100% !default` - You probably wouldn't change this and it
probably didn't need to be a variable.

### Mixins

- `column($columns, $side)` - Considers the `$layout` and sets the width of an element to span the number of given columns, and optionally set a float direction.
- `outer($columns)` - Sets the outer margin width.
- `wrapper` - Elastic gutters, applies `padding: 0 .075em` and `box-sizing:
  border-box`.
- There are mixins for each of the type presets as well.

## Credit

Thanks to Joni Korpi for creating rad minimal tools. I started with the [GGS.scss](http://github.com/jonikorpi/Golden-Grid-System/blob/master/GGS.scss)
file which was contributed by [mikker](http://github.com/mikker)

Thanks to [willhw's](http://github.com/willhw) [compass-less-plugin](http://github.com/willhw/compass-less-plugin) which I used as a reference point.

## Notes

I'm no sass/compass expert. This is my first Compass extension and Ruby Gem and I'm sure there are things that could
be improved. Feel free to make it better. Cheers.
